# This is a real time Data Analysis work.
# Robotics Club Recruitment Analysis Project - by Chanukya Sai

## A few months ago, we Robotics Club @ Sastra (Our students club) conducted an Online exam to recruit our Juniors.
### But it's not a manual task to maintain track how
- How many registered?
- How many students out of registered people, wrote the exam?
- How many Girls, How many boys are in the Datasets?
- How many people from each branch showed up?  
There are many such tasks and questions to keep track of and given answer to.
It's a difficult task to do in short notice unless one knows Python and Pandas and can put them to use.
 
 I've learnt a lot about real time data even though the project is not huge.
 
 ### Input - 2 big Datasets (i) Dataset of exam registrations (ii) Dataset returned by Online exam website with marks.
 ### Output - Several Spreadsheets that clearly show the 
 ####          1.Branch wise count
 ####          2.Marks percentage distributions
 ####          3.Various cut-offs and count of students under the cut-off
 ####          4.In which branches Male and Female are high/low in count and etc.
